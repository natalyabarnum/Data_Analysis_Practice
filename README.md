# Data-Analysis-Practice
Taking the "Stack Overflow Developer Survey" dataset and performing data analysis on it

In the notebook, I answer questions like:
- What industry to developers get paid the most?
- How much does remote working matter to employees?
- How does coding experience affect level of pay?
- What's the most popular method of learning to code?
for this question, I used Tableau to make a visualization. You can view it here:
